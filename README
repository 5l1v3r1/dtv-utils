This project is a collection of utilities and scripts
for digital television projects using bladeRF and GNU Radio


dvbt-blade.py
----------------------------------

This Python script transmit a DVB-T digital television signal using the
bladeRF and gr-dvbt (https://github.com/BogdanDIA/gr-dvbt). A file
containing an MPEG-2 Transport Stream must be supplied as input.
Optionally, an output file can be specified to store the generated
IQ samples (in gr_complex floating point).

Internal parameter values that can be changed:

channel_mhz

5, 6, 7 and 8 MHz channel widths are supported with an appropriate
bladeRF low-pass filter

mode

dvbt.T2k        /* 2048 carriers */
dvbt.T8k        /* 8192 carriers */

code_rate

dvbt.C1_2       /* 1/2 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C2_3       /* 2/3 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C3_4       /* 3/4 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C5_6       /* 5/6 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C7_8       /* 7/8 Viterbi rate */

constellation

dvbt.QPSK       /* QPSK */
dvbt.QAM16      /* QAM16 */
dvbt.QAM64      /* QAM64 */

guard_interval

dvbt.G1_32      /* 1/32 */
dvbt.G1_16      /* 1/16 */
dvbt.G1_8       /* 1/8 */
dvbt.G1_4       /* 1/4 */


dvbtrate.c
----------------------------------

Calculates the precise Transport Stream bit-rate for all DVB-T
constellations, Viterbi code rates and guard intervals for a
given channel width.

usage: dvbtrate <channel bandwidth>

For example:

./dvbtrate 6


qam-blade.py
----------------------------------

This Python script transmit a ANSI/SCTE 07 2013 (also known as
ITU-T J.83 Annex B) 64-QAM digital television signal using the
bladeRF and gr-qam (https://github.com/argilo/gr-qam). A file
containing an MPEG-2 Transport Stream (at 26.970352 Mbps) must
be supplied as input. Optionally, an output file can be specified
to store the generated IQ samples (in gr_complex floating point).

Internal parameter values that can be changed:

The three parameters I_taps, J_increment and Control_Word can be
used to control the interleaver from the following table.

Control_Word    I_taps    J_increment
     0            128          1
     1            128          1
     2            128          2
     3             64          2
     4            128          3
     5             32          4
     6            128          4
     7             16          8
     8            128          5
     9              8          16
    10            128          6
    11          Reserved
    12            128          7
    13          Reserved
    14            128          8
    15          Reserved

The default is Control_Word = 6, I_taps = 128 and J_increment = 4
which seems to be the most commonly used on CATV systems.


dvbs2rate.c
----------------------------------

Calculates the precise Transport Stream bit-rate for all DVB-S2
constellations, LDPC code rates and pilots on/off for a given
symbol rate.

usage: dvbs2rate <symbol rate>

For example:

./dvbs2rate 4500000
