This project is a collection of utilities and scripts
for digital television projects using bladeRF and GNU Radio


dvbt-blade.py
----------------------------------

This Python script transmit a DVB-T digital television signal using the
bladeRF and gr-dvbt (https://github.com/BogdanDIA/gr-dvbt). A file
containing an MPEG-2 Transport Stream must be supplied as input.
Optionally, an output file can be specified to store the generated
IQ samples (in gr_complex floating point).

usage: dvbt-blade.py [-h] [-m MODE] [-c CH] [-C TYPE] [-r RATE] [-g D]
                     [-f FREQ] [--txvga1 gain] [--txvga2 gain] [-o OUT]
                     input-file

positional arguments:
  input-file            Input file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODE, --mode MODE  # of carriers. Options: t2k, t8k (default).
  -c CH, --channel CH   channel width in MHz. Options: 5, 6, 7, 8 (default).
  -C TYPE, --cons TYPE  constellation. qpsk, qam16, qam64 (default).
  -r RATE, --rate RATE  Viterbi rate. 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 (default).
  -g D, --guard D       guard interval. 1/32 (default), 1/16, 1/8, 1/4.
  -f FREQ, --freq FREQ  center frequency (Hz). Default is 429e6.
  --txvga1 gain         bladeRF TXVGA1 gain. Default is -6.
  --txvga2 gain         bladeRF TXVGA2 gain. Default is 9.
  -o OUT, --output OUT  write to specified file.


dvbtrate.c
----------------------------------

Calculates the precise Transport Stream bit-rate for all DVB-T
constellations, Viterbi code rates and guard intervals for a
given channel width.

usage: dvbtrate <channel bandwidth>

For example:

./dvbtrate 6


qam-blade.py
----------------------------------

This Python script transmit a ANSI/SCTE 07 2013 (also known as
ITU-T J.83 Annex B) 64-QAM digital television signal using the
bladeRF and gr-qam (https://github.com/argilo/gr-qam). A file
containing an MPEG-2 Transport Stream (at 26.970352 Mbps) must
be supplied as input. Optionally, an output file can be specified
to store the generated IQ samples (in gr_complex floating point).

Internal parameter values that can be changed:

The three parameters I_taps, J_increment and Control_Word can be
used to control the interleaver from the following table.

Control_Word    I_taps    J_increment
     0            128          1
     1            128          1
     2            128          2
     3             64          2
     4            128          3
     5             32          4
     6            128          4
     7             16          8
     8            128          5
     9              8          16
    10            128          6
    11          Reserved
    12            128          7
    13          Reserved
    14            128          8
    15          Reserved

The default is Control_Word = 6, I_taps = 128 and J_increment = 4
which seems to be the most commonly used on CATV systems.


dvbs2rate.c
----------------------------------

Calculates the precise Transport Stream bit-rate for all DVB-S2
constellations, LDPC code rates and pilots on/off for a given
symbol rate.

usage: dvbs2rate -sx <symbol rate>
Options:
	s = short FECFRAME rates
	x = DVB-S2X rates

For example:

./dvbs2rate 4500000
./dvbs2rate -s 4500000
./dvbs2rate -x 4500000
./dvbs2rate -sx 4500000
