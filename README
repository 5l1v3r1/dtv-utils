This project is a collection of utilities and scripts
for digital television projects using bladeRF and GNU Radio


dvbt-blade.py
----------------------------------

This Python script transmit a DVB-T digital television signal using the
bladeRF and gr-dvbt (https://github.com/BogdanDIA/gr-dvbt). A file
containing an MPEG-2 Transport Stream must be supplied as input.
Optionally, an output file can be specified to store the generated
IQ samples (in gr_complex floating point).

Internal parameter values that can be changed:

channel_mhz

5, 6, 7 and 8 MHz channel widths are supported with an appropriate
bladeRF low-pass filter

mode

dvbt.T2k        /* 2048 carriers */
dvbt.T8k        /* 8192 carriers */

code_rate

dvbt.C1_2       /* 1/2 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C2_3       /* 2/3 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C3_4       /* 3/4 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C5_6       /* 5/6 Viterbi rate */
dvbt.C7_8       /* 7/8 Viterbi rate */

constellation

dvbt.QPSK       /* QPSK */
dvbt.QAM16      /* QAM16 */
dvbt.QAM64      /* QAM64 */

guard_interval

dvbt.G1_32      /* 1/32 */
dvbt.G1_16      /* 1/16 */
dvbt.G1_8       /* 1/8 */
dvbt.G1_4       /* 1/4 */

dvbtrate.c
----------------------------------

Calculates the precise Transport Stream bit-rate for all DVB-T
constellations, Viterbi code rates and guard intervals for a
given channel width.

usage: dvbtrate <channel bandwidth>
